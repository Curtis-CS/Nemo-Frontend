As wildfires become more prevalent, the need for advanced techniques \n\t\t\tin processing video feeds has become crucial for smoke detection. Existing DL-based techniques have been \n\t\t\tdeveloped based on convolution networks and are proven to be effective in wildfire detection. However, these \n\t\t\tdatasets are primarily commercial and/or closed-sourced. One of the few open-source models is Nemo, a benchmark \n\t\t\tfor fine-grained wildfire smoke detection in the incipient stage of a wildfire. Using this model as a basis, our \n\t\t\tteam intends to collaborate with its authors to build a convenient user interface and refined data preprocessing \n\t\t\tfor accurately detecting wildfire smoke in adverse weather or nighttime conditions.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Project Related Resources</h3>\n\t\t<h5>Nemo Github: https://github.com/SayBender/Nemo</h5>\n\t\t<h5>Nemo Research Paper: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/16/3979/htm</h5>\n\t</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"AboutUs\"\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
